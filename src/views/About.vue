    <h1>About (ur)in trouble</h1>
    <p> Mark Kohrman created this app in late 2020 and early 2021 based on a job posting.  It used a Ruby on Rails backend to add all of the Chicago public urination tickets that were issued in a seeds file.  I then built a Vue frontend to display all the data, a Bootstrap table to organize it and make it look nice, and a Bootstrap theme as well.  I installed Vue2Filters so the user can search by street name to see how many tickets were issued in their area.  A very simple app!</p>
